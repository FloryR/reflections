What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?


exit git commit editor: --> 

 Press i to enter inline insert mode. Type the description at the very top, press esc to exit insert mode, then type :x! (now the cursor is at the bottom) and hit enter to save and exit.

If typing :q! instead, will exit the editor without saving (and commit will be aborted)


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
